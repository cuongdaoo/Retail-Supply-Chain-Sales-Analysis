A personal end-to-end analytics project transforming raw retail data into actionable business insights with **Power BI**.

Built an interactive dashboard using the Retail Supply Chain Sales Dataset to visualize and analyze key performance metrics related to Sales, Orders, and Customer behavior.
Performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy, then used advanced filtering and aggregation techniques to highlight trends, top-performing products, and customer segments.
Enabled decision-makers to identify sales patterns, monitor order fulfillment efficiency, and understand customer demographics and purchasing behavior through intuitive visualizations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

In today’s competitive retail landscape, data-driven decisions are key. This project focuses on analyzing sales performance and supply chain operations to uncover critical insights that help businesses:

* 📈 **Improve business strategies** by identifying sales trends
* ⏱ **Optimize delivery times** to boost customer satisfaction
* 🔁 **Predict product return rates** and reveal underlying causes
* 🧩 **Enhance supply chain efficiency** and streamline inventory control

This interactive dashboard empowers stakeholders to explore these insights with clarity and confidence.

</div>

To tackle this real-world data challenge, I:

* 🧹 **Cleaned and transformed** raw transactional data using **Power Query**
* 📊 **Modeled relationships and metrics** using **advanced DAX** for dynamic KPIs
* 🎨 **Designed a clean, interactive dashboard** with a focus on storytelling, usability, and actionable insight
* 🧭 Balanced **analytical depth** with an intuitive **UI/UX** to suit both technical and non-technical users


## 💡 What You’ll Learn

This project highlights several advanced Power BI techniques, including:

* Creating **dynamic titles** and **conditional visuals** using **DAX**
* Designing **interactive filters, bookmarks, and navigation tools**
* Connecting fragmented datasets to surface **hidden trends and root causes**
* Using measures over calculated columns for efficiency and scalability
* Implementing row-level filters and page navigation tricks to improve interactivity

## Recomendation

**1. Improve Business Strategies Based on Sales Trends:**

* **Top Products**: **Canon** leads with \$62K in revenue, followed by **Fellowes** and **Cisco** → Focus on high-profit products.
* **Product Categories**: Highest revenue from **Office Supplies (\$836K)** and **Technology (\$719K)** → Invest more in these categories.
* **Customer Segment**: **Corporate** brings in the most revenue (\$1.16M, 50.56%) → Prioritize B2B sales and customer care strategies.


**2. Optimize Delivery Times to Enhance Customer Experience:**

* **Average Delivery Time**: 34.61 days is too long → Likely harms customer satisfaction.
* **Late Delivery Rate**: 77.20% is very high → Indicates serious logistics issues.
* **Regional Analysis**: **West** has the highest orders and profit margin (14.94%) → Prioritize logistics improvements here.


**3. Predict Return Rates and Identify Root Causes:**

* **Return Rate**: 5.91% → Investigate specific products, segments, or regions with high return rates.
* **Time Trends**: Spikes in June and December 2014 → May be linked to **seasonality** or **product quality** issues.


**4. Enhance Supply Chain Efficiency and Inventory Management:**

* **Low Profit Margin**: Profit is only **\$286.4K (12.47%)** vs. \$2.3M in revenue → Better control of operational and storage costs needed.
* **Regional Insight**: **Central** has low profit despite high orders → Possibly due to high logistics costs.
* **Shipping Mode**: **Standard Class** dominates but may cause delays → Consider increasing **First Class** or **Same Day** options where feasible.
